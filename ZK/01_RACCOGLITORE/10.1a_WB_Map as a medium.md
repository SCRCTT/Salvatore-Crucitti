### Warm-up
We started the morning exchanging some initial feelings about yesterday and our morning. Then we got up and started a warm-up session:

1- while standing we crossed our fingers and swirled our wrists forming the symbol of 8.

2- Subsequently we sought balance with just one foot and with the other lifted we made circles first in one direction and then in another. Then we extended the exercise on the knee in both directions and then with the whole leg, at this moment the pelvis is the fulcrum of the movement.

3- We did the same for the neck and head, try to slowly draw the symbol of 8.

4- Keeping our feet together we went down with our backs and with our torsos "as if hanging" we drew an 8 on the ground.

5- Going up the exercise paying attention to each vertebra that is positioned in a straight line of the back.

6- By tapping our heads with our fingers we tried to activate the muscles of the skull and face. Massaging your temples, eyebrows. Pulling your ears and lobes down.

7- We proposed to warm up the voice. This is why Sophia started a series of exercises based on vowels:

1. Starting from "A" we tried to loosen the muscles located under the jaw. Thinking of keeping her free from any tension. 
2. We brought the vowel to multiple timbres and let the voice flow to multiple points of the body.
3. We tried to bring the voice to the chest and subsequently each to experiment freely.
4. Soon after we experimented the same way with other vowels E, I, O, U.

### Playground

Sophia asked us to represent freely, imagining and drawing the experience of one of our "journeys" which was particularly relevant for us. He explained to us that often by doing this exercise on sheets of paper you have difficulty representing your path because it immediately becomes frustrating that you cannot overcome the limits of the sheet. For this reason Sophia asked us to try this exercise in the car park using chalks.

Once we arrived at the car park, each of us looked for a suitable corner for our "journey". Some of us chose a place suitable for what we wanted to represent, others found some aesthetic and architectural inputs of the place as useful for representation.

Petros, for example, exploited the territory to give an idea of the obstacles that his journey told about a part of his childhood.

Jo talked about her very turbulent car journey with twists and turns.

Juno showed us a path she used to do as a boy with others on friends, crossing a river full of pitfalls against the current to test her tenacity.

Gloria talked about the path that the performers took in the largest coal quarry in Europe, in Germany. A quarry that destroys neighboring villages to expand.

I represented the trip that Gloria and I took this summer to Poland, again for the coal project. We followed the trail of a legend which later turned out to be an unfortunately very sad reality. After the collapse of the USSR, many coal quarries (Kopalnia) were closed in Poland and in one of these countries near Krakow some very poor people had to start digging holes to obtain coal themselves. Unfortunately this phenomenon has not yet stopped, in fact we discovered that even today there are people who dig coal illegally. However, these people are not former miners but they are people with a good salary, a good lifestyle and they do this to get some more money at the end of the month. It is a very particular and rare coal, it is 1% of the world's coal and Anthracite is a very powerful type of coal. With a week of work you can buy a BMW, that's how some of them told us. It's a long and complex story, if you're interested we can talk about it in more depth.

### Reflections and resources on the map as a subject in contemporary art

Once we returned we talked about [Situationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situationist_International), one of the main exponents is Guy Debord (_La Société du Spectacle_, 1967).

We saw a part of this video:

Sophia introduced us to a very interesting group of performers [Wrights and Sites](http://mis-guide.com/) who worked with the map and what it means to use the city as a medium.  In the following video you will find what I mean:

Another fundamental reference is certainly Yoko Ono. She reduced the map to rules.

Other references were when talking about the concept of "emotional map" and "biomapping"

2- Chrisrtian Nold introduces us to the concept of biomapping.
(i got this description from his site)
http://www.biomapping.net/

Over the past five years, over 2000 people have taken part in community mapping projects in over 25 cities around the world. In structured workshops, participants explore their area again with the use of a unique device invented by Christian Nold that records the wearer's galvanic skin response (GSR), which is a simple indicator of emotional arousal in combination with their geographic location. Upon their return, a map is created that displays the high and low points of excitement.

The unique methodology of this project involves working with groups of people to interpret and analyze data and adding annotations to these individual emotional traces. Through this process, community emotional maps of many people's emotional data are constructed, rich in personal observations and highlighting the problems that people feel strongly about.

Finally we drew two concepts that will follow us in producing the task that Sophia will give us. The first is [Psychogeography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography)In 1955, [Guy Debord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Debord "Guy Debord") defined psychogeography as "the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographic environment, whether consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals" Subsequently the concept of [Allegorical Map](https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/allegorical-maps-of-love-courtship-and-matrimony/) a way of using maps as a tool to create visible connections and stimuli in order to activate new reductions on the complexity of a topic. A few examples follow:
