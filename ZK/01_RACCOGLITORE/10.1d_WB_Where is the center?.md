We started from the Malmö Theatre Academy.  
A grey building, enclosed between traffic and the echo of student voices.  
We decided to walk. Without a map. Without a destination.

To every passerby, one question:  
“Where is, for you, outside the center?”  
Each responded with a gesture, a direction, a name.  
We noted it down. We recorded. We left.

The streets changed their skin.  
Shop windows, then peeling walls.  
Smell of bread. Smell of rain.

An old man sent us north.  
A girl pointed us toward a bridge.  
A boy couldn’t quite grasp what “center” meant.

We walked along a geometrically chaotic path.  
We didn’t know where we were heading.  
At times, it felt as if we were walking in circles.

We crossed a park: wet grass, children shouting.  
Then a cemetery: silence, statues, a low-flying crow.

At a certain point, a girl with a dog.  
She sends us to a pub. “That’s outside the center,” she says.

We go in.  
Warm light. Smell of beer and wood.  
A stage, a guitar, laughter.

Someone greets us as if they’d been waiting all along.  
They discover we don’t speak Swedish, and decide, for that night, to speak English.  
Juno goes up on stage. She sings.

The audience listens.  
Someone taps the rhythm with their fingers on a glass.  
The place breathes.

The hosts tell us: “Come, you too. The stage is open.”  
We leave the place with a question lingering.  
Could it be that the center of the city has moved to its outskirts?
