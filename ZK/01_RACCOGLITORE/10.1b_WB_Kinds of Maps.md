# Emotional Maps / Biomapping

The **_Emotion Maps**  are the result of a revolutionary methodology and tool known as _Bio Mapping_, which was devised by  starting in 2004. These maps display the **points of emotional arousal (high or low)** in relation to specific geographic locations. Their creation takes place in structured workshops, where participants explore a local area wearing a unique device, invented by Nold, which records the **Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)** as an indicator of emotional arousal, simultaneously associating it with their location. Community Emotional Maps are constructed by aggregating the emotional data of multiple people and adding annotations and interpretations that highlight the problems that arouse strong feelings in the participants.

# Psicogeography

**Psychogeography** (_Psychogeography_) is the exploration of urban environments that places emphasis on interpersonal connections with arbitrary places and paths. It is a field developed by members of Letterist International and Situationist International, groups influenced by Marxist and anarchist theory, as well as Dadaism and Surrealism. In 1955, Guy Debord defined psychogeography as **"the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographic environment, consciously or unconsciously organized, on the emotions and behavior of individuals"**. The main tactic used to explore psychogeography is _dérive_ (or "drift"), an urban walking practice defined as "a mode of experimental behavior linked to the conditions of urban society: a technique of rapid passage through variable atmospheres". The _dérive_ implies that people abandon their usual motives of movement and allow themselves to be attracted by the terrain and encounters, but combining this letting go with knowledge and calculation of psychogeographic possibilities. Contemporary psychogeography has developed in several directions, including literary, activist and creative strands.

# Allegorical Map

An **Allegorical Map** is a type of map that depicts **conceptual ideas such as places** and the dynamics of the mind or heart such as a journey. Although they have existed for centuries, they experienced significant proliferation in the 18th and 19th centuries. Notable examples of allegorical maps focus on tracing the ups and downs of love, courtship, and marriage. The precursor of this tradition is considered to be Madeleine de Scudéry's _**Carte de tendre**_ (1654-61), where the river of Inclination was followed from New Friendship (_Nouvelle Amitié_) to Love (_Tendre_), avoiding dangers such as Lake Indifference (_Lac D'Indifference_). The marriage maps that followed introduced place names that reflected the pitfalls of married life, such as Cuckold's Shire, Whirlpool of Adultery, or Land of Spinsters, Mountains of Delay, and Port Hymen. Allegorical maps have also explored specific perspectives, such as Georg Mathhaus Seutter's map (1735) which depicts the Siege of the Castle of Love from a male perspective.
