# Workbook ðŸŒ¸

This is Salvatore's workbook.
I'd like to try to implement this into my note-taking system, which I've been developing since the beginning of the course. It's a [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) system. It's based on non-linear note storage. I'm still trying to adapt it to my needs. I'd like to translate everything into English; for now, I've only translated the notes I took during Sophia's class. I promise it will all be translated in the coming weeks.
